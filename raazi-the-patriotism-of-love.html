								<p class="tm-blog-post-description"><strong>By Arpit Agrawal</strong></p>
								<p class="tm-blog-post-description">I watched Raazi sitting in the second row with a fellow-liberal and favourite senior who was visiting India after a couple of years, and I don’t regret that decision a single bit. Raazi was probably a first of its kind movie in Bollywood, based on a premise new to Bollywood and missing from the popular narrative in the country at large. Raazi was a movie about a Kashmiri Muslim’s unquestioned love for her country, that does not turn into hatred for the citizens of the enemy state. It was a story with multiple heros and no villains. For the first time perhaps, we had a movie that blamed war more than one of the parties in the war.</p>
								<p class="tm-blog-post-description">Probably the most intense and dramatic scene of the movie was the one where the children of the army school sang <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-L9vDX0-rQc" target="_blank">Ae Watan</a> on their annual day. At one level, the scene was about a simple annual day in a school where a patriotic song is an obvious choice since it is an army school and that Pakistan is going through the hard phase of its independent journey (the secessionist movement of Bengal). Behind the stage however, their teacher Sehmat sings the song along not for Pakistan but her own land, India. Furthermore the music classes for this song was instrumental in Sehmat in avoiding a major tragedy for her country. The song is written in spoken Urdu by Gulzar sahab, a man born in Pakistan (he still unapologetically calls it home) but brought up in India and is known to be one of the best known Urdu lyricists of our time.</p> 
								<p class="tm-blog-post-description">It is noteworthy that lyrics of the song are absolutely oblivious to the country for which it is sung and unlike most patriotic songs, it has no notion of any enemy. It is written in a language shared between the two countries deepening the ambiguity of Sehmat’s motives. The only word in the song that a lay Indian wouldn’t understand was shaad (happy) although meaning was clear from the context. Also I sincerely suspect most Pakistanis wouldn’t have known the word either had it not been in their national anthem. I suppose the question Gulzar sahab wanted to ask through the song and his daughter through the film was how could the same song be patriotic for two enemy nations. Or in different words, how could two nations with the same idea of patriotism be arch enemies of each other for so long.</p>
								<p class="tm-blog-post-description">If you haven’t already, you should read <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.huffingtonpost.in/2018/05/21/if-a-man-directed-raazi-alia-bhatts-character-would-have-been-reduced-to-a-caricature-says-meghna-gulzar_a_23439612/" target="_blank">this beautiful interview</a> by Meghna Gulzar on how a male director would have completely destroyed Sehmat’s strong character. I agree with each word of hers but would love to add that a male director would also have killed Iqbal’s character. Unheard of in Bollywood movies, Iqbal is a husband extremely supportive and respectful of his wife, without being uxorious. Iqbal maintains an excellent balance between his personal and professional lives by working for the Pakistani army while having due regard for his wife’s loyalty to her nation India. Iqbal is a true anti-national element by today’s narrative in India, not so much because he was a Muslim employed in the Pakistani army but because he housed within himself in a sense of patriotism that did not go to the jingoistic level of demonizing everyone from the enemy nation.</p>
								<p class="tm-blog-post-description">Apart from the movie’s plot and characters, there were subtleties that the movie paid attention to. The portrayal of families living in cantonments, the students of Delhi University, the unions of army wives were all life-like. Sehmat’s Urdu was shown to gradually pick the Pakistani dialect over time as she says to Muneera “Main nahi aa paungi, aap chali jaayein” (An Indian speaker would have conjugated the verb as “chali jao” or “chali jaaiye” instead). Further, the role of Sehmat’s mother is played by her real-life mother Soni Razdan, who also happens to be half-Kashmiri. Without mentioning this explicitly, Meghna Gulzar has shown Teji (the character played by Razdan) to be the Hindu wife of Muslim Hidayat Khan (the character played by Rajit Kapoor). If you loved the movie enough, you would have noticed how Sehmat addresses her father as Abbu, but mother as Amma. The sindoor in Teji’s partitioned hair was unmistakable as well.</p>
								<p class="tm-blog-post-description">Of course, the movie was not without its flaws, some subtler than the others. The family of Hidayat Khan had hardly any glint of being Kashmiri in their accents and the first few minutes of the movie seemed quite rushed to build the plot early; it wouldn’t be unreasonable to expect a more emotional scene when Sehmat gets to know of her father’s disease. Further, there were plenty of holes in the plot lines if you watch it critically; Sehmat gets away too easily so often that after a point, the movie is more fantasy than fiction. But I guess all that is excusable given the beautiful theme, characters, acting and music. In the interest of completeness, I did read the book ‘Calling Sehmat’ after watching the movie and this day, it remains the first case where I found the movie to be as good as the book.</p>
