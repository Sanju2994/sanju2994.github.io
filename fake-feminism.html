                                <h2 class="tm-blog-post-title">Fake Feminism</h2>
								<p class="tm-blog-post-description">A week back, I got to meet one of my professors after two years. As our conversation stretched after working hours, his wife was kind enough to invite me to their home. She was an elegant lady, kind of had a grace about her way of conduct and conversation. Our conversation drifted from my career and plans to their personal life, to what is a common experience of most educated women in the world-subtle sexism.</p>
								<p class="tm-blog-post-description">Educated women get treated differently than educated men, everywhere. Workplace is the most obvious of examples, where it’s no secret that women are expected to be more consistent, less risky and less innovative employees. Any idea coming from women is valued less and criticized more for its flaws. In companies that try to do better by improving the percentage of women workforce, male employees have a tendency to make themselves feel good by hiding every achievement of a woman colleague under the hood of her womanhood. I have seen men who simply cannot expect that a lady is better than them, and that is why she got promoted. Some men spend their entire lives believing that their female colleagues are progressing only by the virtue of office flirting.</p>
								<p class="tm-blog-post-description">One would expect home and family to be better. But I was shocked to know that my experiences in my own family are not uncommon at all. Most educated women (actually people) have the tendency of not spending too much time gossiping, shopping, bitching or doing non value adding activities in general. While in a man, it is seen as a sign of intellect and masculinity, a woman who doesn’t entertain such demands is treated like an arrogant person who doesn’t know her actual place in the world. A man who doesn’t know cooking is still boasted about, yesterday a lady proudly told me how her husband cannot take a glass of water from the RO. The day a woman tries to boast about not knowing how to cook, she will be given life lessons about forgetting her duty, responsibility and culture.</p>
								<p class="tm-blog-post-description">My boyfriend and I are the same age, and hence at very similar points in our career. The only lecture he ever gets is about his career plans, while my mum gives me life lessons on how to choose a career that will help me have a family. When I tell her my future husband should be contributing equally to the household, her unflinching response to me is teaching me how completely ridiculous and unrealistic that expectation is.</p>
								<p class="tm-blog-post-description">I have been shunned out by the family ladies for not being into clothes and jewellery, for not being able to hold an hour long conversation about the neighbour’s family quarrels with deep interest, for not dressing pretty enough, or for not discussing home made remedies about clear skin and beautiful hair as my life achievements. A lovely lady that I love has made it her life mission to make me love shopping. She cannot begin to understand that I’m not playing hard to get, that I simply don’t get the act of seeing 100 clothes and taking hours to pick the perfect one arousing adrenaline in me. She treats me like a poor damaged unfixable, for her, what woman doesn’t enjoy shopping? </p>
								<p class="tm-blog-post-description">For years I enjoyed being called a tomboy, I took some sort of pride in not being like all other girls. The older version of me understands how pathetic it is that I have to feel like a boy to feel valuable. I am not a tomboy, I am a girl, just like thousands of other girls who are different from each other in thousands of ways. Just because I like cricket and can understand how cars work doesn’t make me a boy. It has in fact nothing to do with my gender.</p>
								<p class="tm-blog-post-description">I have devoted my life to fighting and removing sexism from my everyday life. I fight every single act of sexism I experience, conscious or not. But at some point, I start getting tired of fighting for my basic rights, of having independent opinions and of making choices that conflict with the male clan, choices that they have no right to make in the first place. But no fight against sexism is small, no battle so little that it’s not worth fighting. Every act of rebellion is an a dent in the patriarchal mentality. I can’t change all the men, but I can make some good ones see the world from my eyes.</p>
