								<p class="tm-blog-post-description">I quit my last job 2 months ago. Ironically, I jumped into the one thing I promised myself I never would jump into again, a corporate job. Before you leap to conclusions about me being a lazy, spoiled, entitled person with no integrity-hear me out. I ranted a lot about work in my first year, I was one of those people who carried an “I hate my life” sign on their forehead wherever they went. A year later, thanks to the same job I hated, I got this one month study break that made me realize two things-I loved studying, and God, I was tired of hating my life. I wanted to chase happiness (cheesy).</p>
								<p class="tm-blog-post-description">Anyway, I left work at 6 pm today, commonly known as half day. It’s that time of the evening when you know you’ve already spent 8 hours in the office and you’re itching inside to go home but you know the minute you get up and put your bag on your shoulder, 50 pairs of eyes will judge you in a millisecond. However, today my desire to get up and leave got the better of me and here I am, writing about it at 9 pm-the hour of the day I hardly ever get to sit on my bed, stare out of the window, opening a bottle of coke that spills itself on my work laptop. The little joys of life.</p> 
								<p class="tm-blog-post-description">So, back to the beginning. You know that excitement when you quit your first job and think the world will be different somehow. That you’re a step closer to finding yourself, fulfilling your dreams. That anticipation for the better fades away on day no. 7. It hits you hard when on Tuesday no. 2, you find yourself thinking about Saturday again. You don’t know whether to laugh or cry, because in that little moment you know, you will never find your dream job and you will forever, like millions of other people, suck up to the 10-10 lifestyle of modern slavery.</p>
								<p class="tm-blog-post-description">I still dream of getting away though, just that I no longer carry the “I hate my life” sign on my forehead. I laugh at some things I can’t change, and tune out of the rest.</p>
								<p class="tm-blog-post-description">When I was picturing writing this article in my head, I thought I would start with a list of grand dreams that my visionary self saw back in college. I wanted to be a scientist, discover some path breaking technology, make my parents proud, win the Nobel Prize or something. Then I was bought by a company that paid me to be mediocre, AND judged me for not being smart enough for an IITian. Very implicitly, everyone around me was given a free pass to be stupid because they were not IITians. I will never know what hurts you more, being stupid when people don’t expect it or people only expecting stupidity out of you. At least the equalizing conclusion was that all of us were equally worthless.</p>
								<p class="tm-blog-post-description">The irony of it taught me a beautiful thing, your worth will always be subjective in someone else’s eyes, how you live, how happy you are is not a function of how much you earn or succeed, it’s a function of how little you care about the ripples that work creates in your mind-without backing off on your commitments. It’s a function of caring without making it personal, of finding meaning but also realizing that unless you’re Elon Musk most of your jobs are pretty meaningless.</p>
								<p class="tm-blog-post-description">When you decrease the amount of crap you give about everything in corporate that’s designed to make you feel worthless, you start seeing the lighter side of it. Like when  someone talks to me in Portuguese using words like “commitment” and “ownership”, I imagine how they must have been brainwashed when they were a young fresher, or when someone tells me “we have a flexible working policy”, I assume they mean we have flexible working hours in the evening beyond 8 pm. The amount of faith I have left in this country’s private sector is very little, hence I reserve the number of fucks I give for better things.</p>
								<p class="tm-blog-post-description">Am I a slave? No, I wouldn’t compare myself to the brutal lives our ancestors lived. Overpaid slaves? Sure.</p>
